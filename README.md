# Vehicle-Trajectory-Prediction-Veh2Veh
This is the final project for DS201 - Deep Learning for Data Science of the University of Information Technology course.

The purpose of this project is to predict the trajectory of the vehicles in Thu Duc District, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. There are 3 main sub-tasks for this project. 
There are Vehicle Detection, Vehicle Tracking and Vehicle Trajectory Prediction.

I choose YOLOv7 for Vehicle Detection Task, DeepSORT for Vehicle Tracking Task and CNN-LSTM/CNN-GRU for Vehicle Trajectory Task.
